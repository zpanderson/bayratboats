								<p>Welcome to Bay Rat Boats, where family, tradition, and a love for the water come together. Our founder, Brant Nugent, has proudly served in the United States Coast Guard for nearly 20 years. His dedication to service is matched only by his commitment to his family and his passion for boating.</p>
								<p>Brant balances his military career with family life alongside his wonderful wife, Sarah. When you call Bay Rat Boats, Sarah is typically the friendly voice you'll hear on the other end of the line. Together, they are raising four amazing daughters: Isabelle, Allyson, Emilie, and Abigail.</p>
								<p>Bay Rat Boats is a true family business. The inspiration for our venture came when Brant purchased four 16' Carolina Skiffs from his dad and decided to share the joy of boating by renting them out. Since then, we've grown into a close-knit team where everyone plays a role. Brant ensures the boats are in tip-top shape; Sarah handles the phones and technology; and the kids chip in wherever they can. Grandparents are always ready to help with the children, and Grandpa, with his wealth of knowledge about boats and maintenance, ensures we all learn from the best.</p>	
								<p>At Bay Rat Boats, we believe in the power of family and community. We're here to help you create unforgettable memories on the water, just as we do. Join us and become part of our extended family.</p>
